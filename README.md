# Network--Hardening


Scenario :

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. 
Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

The organization’s employees' share passwords.

The admin password for the database is set to the default.

The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 


If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

Provide and explain 1-2 recommendations:

You recommended one or two security hardening practices to help prevent this from occurring again in the future. Explain why the security hardening tool or method selected is effective for addressing the vulnerability.

Why is the recommended security hardening technique effective?
How often does the hardening technique need to be implemented?
